# Arduino CatchGame
Play the classic game of 'catching-falling-objects-with-a-cursor-game' on an Arduino Uno.

The goal of the game is to catch falling objects and reach a high-score. Missing an object will end the game. The game also features several power-ups and power-downs.

The game was created for AAU Imperative Programming Exam (Imperative Programming (IMPR) (EIT1, ITC1, ST1) - AAL E18 [E18-27624]) which i passed with flying colors.
